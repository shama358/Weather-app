# Weather-app

This weather app gives the current temperature and the apparent temperature of a place using the Google Map API and DarkSky API. 

The app has been implemented using 2 asynchonous concepts of Node.js -> callback chaining and Promise chainging. 

Callback Chaining => app.js, geocode, weather.
Promise Chaining => app-promise.js
